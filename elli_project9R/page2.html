    <p>
      keep you in the dark, what had you expected? <br>
      me to make you my art <br>
      and make you a star and get you connected? <br>
      i'll meet you in the park <br>
      i'll be calm and collected <br>
      but we knew right from the start <br>
      that you'd fall apart 'cause i'm too expensive <br>
      your talk'll be somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud <br>
      honestly, i thought that i would be dead by now (wow) <br>
      callin' security, keepin' my head held down <br>
      bury the hatchet or bury your friend right now <br>
      for the debt i owe, gotta sell my soul <br>
      'cause i can't say no, no, i can't say no <br>
      then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close <br>
      and i can't say no, i can't say no
