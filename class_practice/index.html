    <h1>Creative Coding Lab</h1>
    <h3>Course Overview and Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Students will learn computational thinking, program design, and debugging, within a creative context. They will learn elementary theory of color, sound, animation, sound, and text, in the course of writing programs that use these elements. Over the course of a series of individual and group projects, they will develop project development and project management skills and presentation skills. They will reflect on their workflows as an example of a process, on similarities between the process of developing a program and improving a workflow, and on other wider applications of computational thinking and systems thinking. They will learn some tools of coding, web development, and collaborative programming.</p>
